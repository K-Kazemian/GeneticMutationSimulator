# GeneticMutationSimulator
A Python program that simulates random genetic mutations in a DNA sequence and classifies them as silent, missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations. This tool is ideal for learning and visualizing the impact of different mutation types on a protein's amino acid sequence.
